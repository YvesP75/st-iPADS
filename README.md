simple Streamlit demo of an autonomously guided parachute with Reinforcement Learning

This demo is a simplified version of a complete software that allows to autonomously control a parachute. www.hexamind.ai
There is wind in this model and the dynamics of the parachute are very simple. It looks cool though thanks to Streamlit that allowed to rapidly build a simple and effcient interface. 


Install the dependencies with pip
(it runs well with Python 3.7)

and then run:
streamlit run show.py
